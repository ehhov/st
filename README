My configuration of the Suckless st
===================================

I have applied patches:
 - scrollback
 - hidecursor
 - palettes (my variant, also with dedicated bg, fg, and cursor colors)
 - font2 (Symbola. This way st never stops on emojis)

Other changes:
 - (Not my own) Make cursor color follow text color.

st - simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info
